# Game of Life - Thizon Romain - CDOF4

This project implements John Conway's famous "Game of Life" in Node.js. The goal is to simulate a cellular automaton where each cell follows a set of simple rules that determine its future state.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you clone and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Check the "Deployment" section to learn how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Here is what you need to install to run the project:

- Node.js (v16 or higher) click [here](https://nodejs.org/dist/v22.13.0/node-v22.13.0-x64.msi) to dowload the pre-built Windows x64 version (from [nodejs official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download))
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- A terminal

To check if Node.js and npm are installed:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### Installing

Follow these steps to set up the development environment:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RomainThizonzon/GameOFLife-ThizonRomain-CDOF4.git
cd GameOFLife-ThizonRomain-CDOF4
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the project in development mode:

```bash
npm start
```

You can now interact with the game via the console or a graphical interface if implemented.

## Running the Tests

Here is how to run automated tests for this project.

### End-to-End Tests

These tests check the complete flow of the game (e.g., running a full cycle, following the game rules).

To run the tests:

```bash
npm test
```
